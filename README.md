# Wordle Clone by Mitch // Version 1.0

## Gameplay

Just like in the actual [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), the objective of this game is to try 
to guess the 5 letter word. To do this, you must uncover hints that you can use to try to piece together what the solution is!
You have up to **six** attempts to try to guess the word. If you don't get it in less than six, the game is over!

Use your keyboard to type out the words that you want to use and then hit `ENTER` / `Return`

ðŸŸ© - A **green** square indicates that the letter is in the correct spot

ðŸŸ¨ - A **yellow** square indicates that the letter is in fact in the word, but in a different spot

â¬› - A **gray** square indicates that the letter is not found in the word at all
